# SK6812
SK6812 is a set of smart control circuit and a light emitting circuit in
one of the controlled LED source. The outer type is the same with a
5050LED chip, each element is a pixel. Pixels contained within the
intelligent digital interface data latch signal shaping amplification circuit,
power supply circuit, a built-in constant current circuit, high precision
RC oscillator, the output is driven by the patented PWM technology,
effectively guarantee the pixels in the color of the light high consistency.
Data protocol using unipolar NRZ communication mode, the pixel is
reset after the end of DIN, accept the data transmitted from the
controller to the 24bit, the first to send data by the first pixel to pixel
extraction, internal data latch, the remaining data after the internal
plastic the processing circuit after shaping amplification through the
DO port output began to turn to the next cascade of pixels, each pixel
through a transmission signal, reduce. Pixel using automatic shaping
forwarding technology, makes the number of cascade without signal
transmission limit of the pixel, only limited signal transmission speed.
The
LED has a low driving voltage, environmental protection and energy
saving, high brightness, scattering angle, good consistency, low power,
long life and so on. The control circuit is integrated in the LED above,
more simple circuit, small volume, easy installation.
