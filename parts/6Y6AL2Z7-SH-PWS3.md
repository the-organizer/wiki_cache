# SH-PWS3

Buck-Booster Details:
Module parameters:

Module Name : 150W boost constant current module

Module Properties: non-isolated step-up module (BOOST)

Input voltage : 10-32V input

Input Current : 16A (MAX) exceeds 8A please enhance heat dissipation

Quiescent current : 15mA (12V liter 20V , the output voltage , the higher the current will increase too quiet )

Output voltage : 10-46V continuously adjustable ( the default output 19V, the treasurer For other voltages please explain . )

10-46V fixed output (see the treasurer required voltage )

Optional output 10-60V adjustable output module , please leave a message after photographed require the same price.

Default shipping is 10-46V adjustable output

Output Current : 8A MAX than 4A please enhance heat dissipation ( input, output pressure related , the greater the pressure the smaller the output current )
