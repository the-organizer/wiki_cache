The seven elements of the display can be lit in different combinations to represent the Arabic numerals. Often the seven segments are arranged in an oblique (slanted) arrangement, which aids readability.[citation needed] In most applications, the seven segments are of nearly uniform shape and size (usually elongated hexagons, though trapezoids and rectangles can also be used), though in the case of adding machines, the vertical segments are longer and more oddly shaped at the ends in an effort to further enhance readability.

The numerals 6 and 9 may be represented by two different glyphs on seven-segment displays, with or without a 'tail'.[2][3] The numeral 7 also has two versions, with or without segment F.[4]

The seven segments are arranged as a rectangle of two vertical segments on each side with one horizontal segment on the top, middle, and bottom. Additionally, the seventh segment bisects the rectangle horizontally. There are also fourteen-segment displays and sixteen-segment displays (for full alphanumerics); however, these have mostly been replaced by dot matrix displays. Twenty-two segment displays capable of displaying the full ASCII character set[5] were briefly available in the early 1980s, but did not prove popular.

The segments of a 7-segment display are referred to by the letters A to G, where the optional decimal point (an "eighth segment", referred to as DP) is used for the display of non-integer numbers.[6][7]
